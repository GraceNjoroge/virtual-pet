READ.ME Virtual pet project

My Virtual Pet of choice is Balsam the Koala!

Caring for the Virtual Pet
Like all pets, Balsam has needs and emotions. It gets hungry, so it will need to be fed. To keep it happy and not bored it will need to be played with and since it’s a Koala, it loves taking naps
Pet characteristics: 
hunger
This text box will display a number to show how hungry the pet is.

Play

Interacting with the pet
There are prompts to enable interaction with the pet. Each button is set to ONCE. 

Start
This prompt will start the Personal Pet program.

feed
This prompt will allow to feed the Personal Pet so that it is not hungry.

play
This prompt will allow to play with the virtual Pet to make it happy, more hungry and sleepy.

sleep

Entering procedures for interacting with pet

I will write code to set starting values. For example, the virtual Pet begins with a Hunger level of 20.

If it plays, hunger level increases by 25. If hunger level exceeds 50, the pet (balsam) will die from hunger and stop the game.
